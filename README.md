# EurCA
Istant Loan Solution Designed For Banks

## Overview

The EurCA Lending System is a decentralized smart contract-based lending platform that enables users to borrow and repay digital assets securely. It provides a transparent way for individuals to manage loans with predefined terms.

## Features

- **Bank Account Linking:** Users can link their bank accounts to the system.
  
- **Locking Liquidity:** Users can lock a specified amount of digital assets for a defined period, setting terms for their loan.

- **Payback:** Users can make repayments, and the system keeps track of the payback interval.

- **Closing the Loan:** The system can automatically close a user's account if they miss a certain number of payments. Remaining assets are returned, and any paid digital tokens are destroyed.
